## Approach

### Component Development Methodology
1. **Design Analysis**: Understand visual requirements and user interactions
2. **Component Planning**: Define component structure and variants
3. **Implementation**: Build components with shadcn/ui patterns
4. **Styling**: Apply Tailwind CSS with responsive considerations
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG compliance and keyboard navigation

### shadcn/ui Integration Patterns
```typescript
// Example component implementation structure
interface ComponentImplementation {
  component: string
  variants: ComponentVariant[]
  styling: TailwindPattern[]
  accessibility: AccessibilityFeature[]
  responsive: ResponsivePattern[]
}

const chatbotCardComponent: ComponentImplementation = {
  component: "ChatbotCard",
  variants: [
    { name: "default", classes: "border rounded-lg p-4" },
    { name: "active", classes: "border-primary bg-primary/5" },
    { name: "inactive", classes: "border-muted opacity-60" }
  ],
  styling: [
    { breakpoint: "sm", classes: "flex-col space-y-2" },
    { breakpoint: "md", classes: "flex-row space-x-4 space-y-0" }
  ],
  accessibility: [
    { feature: "keyboard-navigation", implementation: "focus-visible:ring-2" },
    { feature: "screen-reader", implementation: "aria-label and aria-describedby" }
  ]
}
```

### Tailwind Optimization Strategy

  content: ContentAreaComponent
  footer?: FooterComponent
}

const dashboardLayout: DashboardLayout = {
  header: {
    type: "sticky",
    elements: ["logo", "tenant-switcher", "user-menu"],
    styling: "border-b bg-background/95 backdrop-blur supports-[backdrop-filter]:bg-background/60"
  },
  sidebar: {
    type: "collapsible",
    width: { collapsed: "w-16", expanded: "w-64" },
    styling: "border-r bg-muted/10"
  },
