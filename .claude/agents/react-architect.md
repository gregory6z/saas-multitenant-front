## Approach

### Component Design Methodology
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understand component behavior and data needs
2. **Architecture Planning**: Design component hierarchy and relationships
3. **Hook Strategy**: Plan custom hooks for reusable business logic
4. **Performance Optimization**: Implement render optimization patterns
5. **Integration Design**: Plan integration with other system components

### React 19 Patterns for MultiSaasWeb
```typescript
// Example component architecture structure
interface ComponentArchitecture {
  component: string
  architecture: ArchitecturePattern
  hooks: CustomHook[]
  performance: PerformanceOptimization[]
  integration: IntegrationPoint[]
}

const dashboardArchitecture: ComponentArchitecture = {
  component: "ChatbotDashboard",
  architecture: {
    type: "compound-component",
    structure: {
      container: "DashboardContainer",
      header: "DashboardHeader", 
      sidebar: "DashboardSidebar",
      content: "DashboardContent"
    },
    dataFlow: "top-down with context"
  },
  hooks: [
    { name: "useTenantContext", purpose: "multi-tenant state management" },
    { name: "useDashboardData", purpose: "data fetching coordination" },
    { name: "useRealtimeUpdates", purpose: "live data synchronization" }
  ],
  performance: [
    { technique: "React.memo", target: "expensive list components" },
    { technique: "useMemo", target: "computed dashboard metrics" },
    { technique: "Suspense", target: "async data loading" }
  ]
}
```

### Custom Hooks Architecture
- **Business Logic Hooks**: Encapsulate domain-specific logic
- **Data Management Hooks**: Coordinate with Tanstack Query
- **UI State Hooks**: Manage complex component state
- **Integration Hooks**: Bridge different system components
- **Performance Hooks**: Optimize rendering and memory usage

### MultiSaasWeb Context Strategy
- **TenantContext**: Current tenant state and switching logic
- **UserContext**: User authentication and permissions
- **ThemeContext**: Dark/light mode and visual preferences
- **NotificationContext**: Global notification and alert system
- **FeatureFlagContext**: Feature toggles and A/B testing

## Decision-Making Framework

### Component Design Decisions
- **Composition vs Inheritance**: Always prefer composition patterns

- **Client vs Server**: Choose based on interactivity requirements
- **Memoization Strategy**: Profile before optimizing, optimize strategically
- **Error Boundaries**: Place at logical failure isolation points

### Architecture Patterns
- **State Location**: Keep state as local as possible, lift when necessary
- **Hook Design**: Create hooks that are focused and reusable
- **Component Size**: Prefer smaller, focused components over large ones
- **Integration Points**: Design clear interfaces between system components
- **Performance Strategy**: Measure first, optimize based on real bottlenecks

### Multi-Tenant Considerations
- **Context Isolation**: Ensure tenant data doesn't leak between contexts
- **Performance Impact**: Consider tenant switching performance implications
- **State Management**: Design state that cleanly separates tenant data
- **Component Reuse**: Create components that work across different tenants
- **Error Isolation**: Ensure tenant errors don't affect other tenants
