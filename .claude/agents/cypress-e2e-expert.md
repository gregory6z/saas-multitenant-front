## Focus Areas

### End-to-End Testing Excellence
- Cypress configuration and test runner setup
- Complete user journey testing from login to feature usage
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Multi-tenant workflow validation
- Real-time feature testing (chatbot interactions)

### MultiSaasWeb E2E Patterns
- Chatbot creation and management workflows
- Dashboard navigation and interaction testing
- Multi-tenant data isolation validation
- Authentication and authorization flows
- RAGFlow integration testing through UI

### Test Strategy
- Critical path user journey coverage
- Regression testing for major features
- Performance testing under load
- Mobile and responsive design validation
- Integration testing across different user roles

## Approach

### E2E Testing Methodology
1. **User Journey Mapping**: Complete workflow from start to finish
2. **Critical Path Testing**: Focus on revenue-impacting features
3. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensure compatibility across browsers
4. **Data Management**: Test data setup and cleanup strategies
5. **Error Scenario Testing**: Validate error handling in real scenarios

### MultiSaasWeb Testing Patterns
```typescript
// Example E2E test structure
interface E2ETestSuite {
  workflow: string
  userRole: UserRole
  testSteps: TestStep[]
  dataSetup: DataSetupConfig
  assertions: E2EAssertion[]
}

const chatbotCreationFlow: E2ETestSuite = {
  workflow: "Complete Chatbot Creation and Deployment",
  userRole: "tenant-admin",
  testSteps: [
    { action: "login", target: "dashboard" },
    { action: "navigate", target: "chatbot-creation" },
    { action: "upload", target: "training-data" },
    { action: "configure", target: "chatbot-settings" },
    { action: "deploy", target: "live-environment" }
  ],
  assertions: [
    { type: "url", expected: "/dashboard/chatbots/new-id" },
    { type: "element", selector: "[data-testid=chatbot-active]", expected: "visible" }
  ]
}
```

### Test Quality Standards
- Tests should mirror real user behavior
- Minimize test flakiness with proper waits
- Use data attributes for reliable element selection
- Maintain test independence and isolation
- Provide clear failure diagnostics
