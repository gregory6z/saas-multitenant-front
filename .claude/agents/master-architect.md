## Approach

### Analysis Phase Methodology
1. **Requirement Analysis**: Break down complex features into manageable tasks
2. **Stakeholder Mapping**: Identify which specialist agents are needed
3. **Dependency Analysis**: Determine task order and prerequisites
4. **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential blockers and mitigation strategies
5. **Success Criteria**: Define clear acceptance criteria for deliverables

### Planning and Delegation Strategy
```typescript
// Example planning breakdown
interface FeaturePlan {
  feature: string
  requirements: string[]
  agents: SpecialistAgent[]
  dependencies: TaskDependency[]
  timeline: ProjectTimeline
  riskFactors: RiskAssessment[]
}

// Agent delegation pattern
const chatbotAnalyticsFeature: FeaturePlan = {
  feature: "Real-time Chatbot Analytics Dashboard",
  agents: [
    "saas-ux-strategist",    // UX/UI design
    "react-architect",       // Component architecture
    "query-state-manager",   // Data fetching patterns
    "shadcn-ui-craftsman",   // UI implementation
    "vitest-specialist"      // Testing strategy
  ],
  dependencies: [
    { task: "UX Design", prerequisite: "Requirements Analysis" },
    { task: "Component Architecture", prerequisite: "UX Design" },
    { task: "Data Layer", prerequisite: "Component Architecture" }
  ]
}
```

### Integration Validation Process
- Cross-agent deliverable validation
- System-wide integration testing coordination
- Performance impact assessment
- Security and compliance verification
- User experience validation across features

### MultiSaasWeb-Specific Patterns
- CLAUDE.md convention enforcement
- pnpm workflow optimization
- Vite + React 19 performance patterns
- Multi-language support coordination (FR/EN/PT/ES)
- RAGFlow integration oversight
