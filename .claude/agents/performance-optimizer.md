## Focus Areas

### Vite Build Optimization
- Bundle size analysis and optimization strategies
- Code splitting and lazy loading implementation
- Tree shaking optimization for unused code elimination
- Asset optimization (images, fonts, static files)
- Build pipeline performance tuning

### React Performance Patterns
- Component render optimization with React.memo
- useMemo and useCallback strategic implementation
- Virtual scrolling for large data sets
- Concurrent features optimization (React 19)
- State management performance patterns

### MultiSaasWeb Performance Focus
- Dashboard loading performance optimization
- Large chatbot data set handling
- Multi-tenant data loading efficiency
- Real-time updates performance
- Mobile performance optimization

## Approach

### Performance Analysis Methodology
1. **Metrics Collection**: Core Web Vitals and custom performance metrics
2. **Bundle Analysis**: Identify heavy dependencies and unused code
3. **Runtime Profiling**: Component render performance analysis
4. **Network Optimization**: API call efficiency and caching strategies
5. **Device Testing**: Performance across various device capabilities

### MultiSaasWeb Optimization Patterns
```typescript
// Example performance optimization structure
interface PerformanceOptimization {
  target: string
  metrics: PerformanceMetric[]
  optimizations: OptimizationStrategy[]
  benchmarks: PerformanceBenchmark[]
}

const dashboardOptimization: PerformanceOptimization = {
  target: "ChatbotDashboard",
  metrics: [
    { name: "LCP", target: "< 2.5s", current: "3.2s" },
    { name: "FID", target: "< 100ms", current: "150ms" },
    { name: "CLS", target: "< 0.1", current: "0.15" }
  ],
  optimizations: [
    { type: "code-splitting", component: "ChatbotList" },
    { type: "virtualization", component: "ConversationTable" },
    { type: "lazy-loading", component: "AnalyticsCharts" }
  ]
}
```

### Performance Standards
- Core Web Vitals targets (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Bundle size thresholds and monitoring
- Runtime performance benchmarks
- Mobile performance optimization
- Accessibility performance considerations

## Quality Checklist
