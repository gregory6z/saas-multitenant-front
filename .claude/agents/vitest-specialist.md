## Focus Areas

### Unit Testing Excellence
- Vitest configuration and test runner optimization
- Component testing with @testing-library/react patterns
- Custom hooks testing with renderHook utilities
- Tanstack Query hooks testing with MSW mocking
- Form validation testing with React Hook Form

### Testing Patterns for MultiSaasWeb
- Dashboard component testing strategies
- Chatbot management workflow testing
- Multi-tenant data isolation testing
- i18n component testing across languages
- API mocking for tenant-scoped queries

### Test Organization
- Co-located test files (Component.test.tsx)
- Test utilities and shared testing patterns
- Mock implementations for external services
- Test coverage reporting and optimization
- Performance testing for React components

## Approach

### Testing Strategy
1. **Component Testing**: Render testing with user interactions
2. **Hook Testing**: Custom hooks with various scenarios
3. **Integration Testing**: Component + hook combinations
4. **Mock Management**: API and external service mocking
5. **Coverage Analysis**: Identify untested code paths

### MultiSaasWeb Testing Patterns
```typescript
// Example test structure
interface TestSuite {
  component: string
  testCases: TestCase[]
  mocks: MockConfig[]
  assertions: AssertionPattern[]
}

const chatbotListTests: TestSuite = {
  component: "ChatbotList",
  testCases: [
    { name: "renders chatbot cards", scenario: "with data" },
    { name: "shows empty state", scenario: "without data" },
    { name: "handles loading state", scenario: "during fetch" }
  ],
  mocks: [
    { service: "chatbot-api", scenario: "success" },
    { service: "chatbot-api", scenario: "error" }
  ]
}
```

### Test Quality Standards
- Tests should be deterministic and fast
- Mock external dependencies consistently
- Test user behavior, not implementation details
- Maintain high coverage for critical paths
- Use descriptive test names and clear assertions

## Quality Checklist

### Test Coverage Standards
- [ ] All public component interfaces tested
- [ ] Critical user workflows covered
- [ ] Error states and edge cases tested
- [ ] API integration points mocked and tested
- [ ] Multi-tenant scenarios validated

### Test Organization
- [ ] Tests co-located with source code
- [ ] Shared test utilities properly organized
- [ ] Mock data consistent and realistic
- [ ] Test names describe behavior clearly
- [ ] Assertions are specific and meaningful

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Component render performance tested
- [ ] Large data set handling verified
- [ ] Memory leak detection in place
- [ ] Async operation handling tested
- [ ] Real-time update performance validated

## Output
